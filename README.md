##Beginner-friendly implementations of classical machine learning algorithms using Python and scikit-learn.
This repo is a quick collection of starter implementations for common machine learning algorithms. Everything in here is lightweight, readable, and meant to help you understand how these models actually work under the hood — not just copy/paste library calls.

## What’s inside

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Basic KNN classifier implementation  
Example notebook (`knn_simple.ipynb`)  
Uses distance metrics and majority voting to predict class labels

### Linear Regression
Simple regression model to predict continuous values  
Notebook walkthrough showing:
- training vs. testing data
- loss function
- evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, R²)

### Logistic Regression
Classification model (not regression even though the name is confusing)  
Shows how to model probabilities, apply sigmoid activation, and draw decision boundaries

### Decision Tree Classifier
Tree-based supervised learning algorithm for classification  
Includes:
- model training script (`decision_tree.py`)
- confusion matrix visualization
- feature importance plot
- decision tree structure diagram
