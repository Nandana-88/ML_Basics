Machine Learning Basics

This repo is a quick collection of starter implementations for common machine learning algorithms. Everything in here is lightweight, readable, and meant to help you understand how these models actually work under the hood — not just copy/paste library calls.

What’s inside
1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Basic KNN classifier implementation

Example notebook (knn_simple.ipynb)

Uses distance metrics + voting to predict class labels

2. Linear Regression

Simple regression model to predict continuous values

Notebook walkthrough showing:

training vs. testing data

loss function

evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, R²)

3. Logistic Regression

Classification model (not regression even though the name is confusing)

Shows how to model probabilities and decision boundaries
